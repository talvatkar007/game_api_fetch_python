Reqirements:

As a developer, I want to hit an external API, extract game records, 
and download categorized images, so that assets are available for offline 
processing and UI representation.

API Endpoint:

https://partner-auth.dev-lab.uk/api/providers/1/games

Logic:

    Fetch data from the above API.

    For each game record in the response:

      Extract the field image_square (URL of the image).

        Extract the fields name, game_code, and category.

    Download each image from the image_square URL.

    Save the image using the format: {name}_{game_code}.jpg

    Organize images into folders based on the category field:

       For example:
      slots/Battle for Troy_11501.jpg

Sample Game Record:

{
  "name": "Battle for Troy",
  "game_code": 11501,
  "category": "slots",
  "description": "Embark on an epic journey in Battle of Troy where ancient riches await!...",
  "image_square": "https://imagedelivery.net/XKWmn0SnwMGQ1FRiU5kurQ/2c11f4d7-84c8-4e76-7192-934b8e5a8400/public"
}

Acceptance Criteria:

    All game records are processed without failure.
    Images are downloaded and saved with proper naming.
    Folder structure is organized by category.
    Provide a sample screenshot of folder structure and downloaded images.
